          provision of their services.
        </li>
        <li>
          Balancer does not set any cookies. However, we use third party service

        We do not typically request, collect or use personal information from
        you except under limited circumstances as described herein. With the
        exception of your wallet address, there is no reason for you to provide

        Information We Collect Automatically When You Interact With&nbsp;Us
      </h3>
      <p>
        When you access or use our UI, we may automatically collect certain
        information, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em class="font-semibold"> Device and Usage Information:</em> We (and
          our service providers) collect information about how you access the
          UI, including data about the device and network you use, such as your
          hardware model, operating system version, mobile network, browser
          type, IP address and app version. We do not typically, but we may,
          also collect information about your activity on the UI, such as access
          times, pages viewed, links clicked, and the page you visited before
          navigating to the UI.

            >Information Collected by Cookies and Similar Tracking
            Technologies:</em
          >
          We do not typically use tracking technologies, such as cookies and web
          beacons, to collect information about you; however, third parties we
          rely on may do so. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard
          drive or in device memory that help us improve the UI and your
          experience, see which areas and features of the UI are popular, and
          count visits. Web beacons (also known as “pixel tags” or “clear GIFs”)
          are electronic images that we use on the UI to help deliver cookies,
          count visits, and understand usage and campaign effectiveness. For
          more information about cookies and how to disable them, see our
          <router-link :to="{ name: 'cookies-policy' }">

          and the Your Choices section below.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Information We Collect from Other&nbsp;Sources</h3>

      <p>
        We do not typically obtain information from third-party sources in order
        to provide business services. We do not sell information we collect.
      </p>

      <h3>Information We Derive</h3>

      <p>
        We may derive limited information or draw inferences about you based on
        the information we have access to or receive, most importantly, from our
        service providers. Your wallet and IP address is accessible to Balancer
        and its vendor(s). We may make inferences about you based on your wallet
        or IP address.

      <h2>Additional Disclousures for Individuals in Europe</h2>

      <p>
        If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the United
        Kingdom, or Switzerland, you have certain rights and protections under
        the law regarding the processing of your personal data, and this section
        applies to you.
      </p>
      <h3>Legal Basis for Processing</h3>

      <p>
        Balancer does not typically process user personal data. If Balancer
        processes data, such as a wallet address and certain IP addresses, it
        will do so in reliance on the following lawful bases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To perform our responsibilities under our contract with you (e.g.,
          providing access to the UI you requested).
        </li>
        <li>
          When we have a legitimate interest in processing your personal data to
          operate the UI or protect our interests (e.g., to adhere with
          applicable laws, rules and regulations, provide, maintain, and improve
          our products and UI, conduct data analytics, and communicate with
          you).
        </li>
        <li>To comply with our legal obligations.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Data Retention</h3>

      <p>
        We do not maintain customer accounts or store personal data. Our vendor
        will store your wallet address in order to provide requested services.
      </p>
      <h3>Data Subject Requests</h3>
      <p>
        Subject to certain limitations, you have the right to request access to
        the personal data we hold about you and to receive your data in a
        portable format, the right to ask that your personal data be corrected
        or erased, and the right to object to, or request that we restrict,
        certain processing. Balancer does not typically hold or store such
        personal data.
